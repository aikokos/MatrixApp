# MatrixApp

study base object oriented design principles.
Create generic classes for representing square, symmetric and diagonal matrices (a symmetric matrix is 
a square matrix that coincides with its transpose to it, a diagonal matrix is a square matrix whose elements outside 
the main diagonal obviously have default values for the element type). Describe in the created classes an event that 
occurs when a matrix element with indices (i, j) changes. To provide the possibility of extending the functionality 
of the class hierarchy,
adding the possibility for the addition operation of two matrices of any kind. Develop unit-tests.
